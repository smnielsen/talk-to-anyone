# Talk to Anyone

This app will let you choose input and output languages. 
The monkey will listen, translate and then talk back to you in the language of your choice.

- Works for over 90 languages

POC during hackday.
**DEFINITELY** not something that should go to production.

## Installation

> brew install yarn

> yarn install
## Commands

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

> yarn start

  Starts the development server.

> yarn build

  Bundles the app into static files for production.

> yarn test

  Starts the test runner.

> yarn eject

  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
